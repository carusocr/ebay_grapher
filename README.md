# ebay_grapher

Accept a search item, return a graph (scatter plot?) of items. X-axis is 'time to sell?' How to 
represent an item that closed without sale? Y-axis can be price. Each item is represented by 
a dot, ideally each one can be clickable or hoverable for more information.


What other data can I represent? 

- minimum buy price
- buy now price
